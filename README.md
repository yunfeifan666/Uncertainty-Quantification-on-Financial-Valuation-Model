#•Created a general framework for solving uncertainties: including randomization of vectors, dimensionality reduction via KL expansion, and distribution transformation using the maximum entropy principle
#•Utilized stochastic solvers (Monte Carlo, Galerkin method, and Stochastic Collocation method) to map random inputs to outputs and generated probability distributions
